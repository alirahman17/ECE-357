# ECE-357: Operating Systems

## Problem Set 1: Minicat
A program to become familiar with system calls and error checking that read input files or standard input and concatenated the inputs to a specified output file or to standard output.

## Problem Set 2: File Search
A program that takes a file parameter and an optional starting path to recursively find and mark files that are either hard links or symbolic links to the file specified as the primary argument to the program.

## Problem Set 3: Shell
An implementation of a shell program that also acts as a script interpretor.  The user can use built in commands such as 'cd' and 'ls' to navigate and display the contents of different directories in addition to executing programs and interpreting bash scripts.

## Problem Set 4: Pipe Word Search
A program that that implements pipes in order to run three seperate programs that are directly piped into one another.  In order to test these pipes, there is a program that generates a random string of characters of variable length, a program that searches a dictionary for a number of specified words as arguments to the program, and a pager that acts similar to the more function.

## Problem Set 5: MMapping
A set of exercises that show the functionality and implementation of mmap to be used instead of opening, reading and writing to and from files.  In essence a way to redo problem set 1 in a simpler fashion with files loaded to memory rather than being treated as file descriptors.

## Problem Set 6: Spinlock
A set of programs that are used to implement a spinlock as the basis for multi-threaded programming.  These programs consist of header files that define the functions of each C file, definitions for structs and functions to be used in other programs, and tests for each stage of the spinlock.

## Problem Set 7: Assembly
A group of exercises that demonstrate the functionality of Assembly code in 64 bit architecture and the tradeoffs between compuled code in C and assembly.
